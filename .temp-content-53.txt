Team Transition Planning

- Mickey D leaving around November 15th
- Multiple Singapore candidates interested in Australia move
  - Fahad Aman recommended by colleagues (principal level)
  - Second candidate: FSI-focused principal, strong on AEP/data, needs retail learning
- Internal options considered: Clara, Greg for continuity
- Ron not suitable for transition role

Content Team Structure Review

- Current model: 2 content specialists (Radhika, Carol), 1 data specialist
- Split implemented due to both being new to respective areas
- Model working well with new releases acceleration after years of stagnation
- Coverage benefits when either specialist unavailable
- No planned changes for next year given recent team shifts (Beck departure, Kyler onboarding)

- Format similar to Vegas: morning keynotes, afternoon breakouts by function
- First kickoff in 4-5 years for sales team
- Sydney ruled out due to Indian team visa timing issues

- Current situation: Complete communication blackout after September 22nd deadline
- Timeline breakdown:
  - August compelling event missed

  - Revised to $90k, pushed for September 22nd close
  - Optimizely renewal end of September (likely renewed)
- CIO Jason avoiding contact despite initial enthusiasm
- Stakeholder meetings scheduled: Rapha (marketing) Friday, reaching out to SEO/content teams
